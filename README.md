# 42cursus-fdf ([Subject](/.github/en.subject.pdf))

## Description
All programs that you wrote until now were executed in text mode on your terminal. Now, let’s discover something more exciting: how to open a graphics window and draw inside? To start your journey in graphic programming, FdF offers to represent “iron wire” meshing in 3D.

## Usage

```unix
  ./fdf <path_to_map> 
```
